## ‚úÖ Questions and Summaries

### 1. **GAN Architecture**
- **Topic**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- **Summary**: Explained the adversarial training process where a generator and discriminator compete. Described their individual goals, loss functions, and how they improve through feedback. A textual diagram of the architecture and data flow is included.

### 2. **Ethics and AI Harm**
- **Topic**: Allocational Harm
- **Summary**: Discussed real-world harm when AI systems impact access to resources (e.g., jobs, credit, healthcare). Provided examples and explained how such harms are caused and how they can be mitigated.

### 3. **Interpretability in Machine Learning**
- **Topic**: Explainability of ML Models
- **Summary**: Highlighted why interpretability is crucial in high-stakes environments like finance and medicine. Covered tools such as LIME, SHAP, and saliency maps to visualize and interpret model decisions.

### 4. **Bias in Machine Learning**
- **Topic**: Bias Detection
- **Summary**: Outlined sources of bias in datasets and models. Explained the consequences of biased predictions and the need for auditing and fairness checks.

### 5. **Addressing Bias**
- **Topic**: Bias Mitigation Techniques
- **Summary**: Described techniques to address bias including data diversification, preprocessing, and the use of fairness-aware algorithms. Emphasized ethical responsibility in deploying AI systems.
